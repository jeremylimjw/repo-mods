## Plugin GUID: Index154.SpawnConfig

[General]

## Prevent enemy spawning entirely, turning the game into a no-stakes gathering simulator or for when you want to test something in peace
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Prevent enemy spawning = false

## Whether the mod should update your custom SpawnGroups config at launch by adding all loaded enemy groups that are missing from it
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Re-add missing groups = false

## All three weights of an enemy group will be multiplied by this value for the current level after having been selected once. Effectively reduces the chance of encountering multiple copies of the same group in one level. Set to 1.0 to "disable"
# Setting type: Double
# Default value: 0.5
Repeat spawn weight multiplier = 0.5

## If set to true, any group containing a single invalid spawn object will be ignored completely. If set to false, only the individual spawn object will be ignored and the group can still spawn as long as it contains at least one valid enemy
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Ignore groups with invalid spawnObjects = true
