| The Gusher is a hazardous creature, he likes to wander around <br> and rest in sneaky places.<br>He is completely blind.. <br> But a good listener in compensation. <br> Very sensitive personality however.| Very much like the Gusher. <br> However, the Roaster likes to keep the conversations short. <br> He's the upgrade. <br> Not common in earlier levels. <br> Probably a good thing...|

### Some people suggested I should make a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/magicwesley) so here it is.
