# BoomboxCart 

Adds a "Boombox" component into the cart with its own UI that plays video links as audio from the cart. 
Has volume and quality sliders as well to configure the music to your liking. One player can control the 
Boombox UI at any time, and everyone (with the mod installed) can hear the songs you play too!

Current websites you can play audio from:
 - Youtube
 - SoundCloud
 - Rutube
 - music.yandex
 - Bilibili

Reach out to me (link at the end) for issues with any service listed here, or suggestions on adding new ones from <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md">these sites</a>

## Usage

<p>Make sure everyone in your lobby has the mod installed!</p>

<p>How to use mod:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Grab on to a cart</li>
    <li>Press 'Y' on your keyboard (note: only one person can have the UI open at a time)</li>
    <li>Paste in a video link for the music/video you want to play</li>
    <li>Press 'Play', wait a moment for the video to download (longer videos may take longer), and audio should start playing!</li>
</ol>
<p>Known Issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Singleplayer does NOT work at all. Clicking "Host Game" and playing solo works though!</li>
    <li>Small stutter when audio is downloaded (longer video, longer stutter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible Future Features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Configurable keybind for opening the boombox UI</li>
    <li>A config file to configure a few values that some people might want to</li>
    <li>Visual indicators on the actual cart for what's happening with the boombox (maybe the lil jumpy sound bars when audio is playing), only if I learn how to do that...</li>
    <li>A global mute option in settings to mute all boombox audio if you can't stand your lobby</li>
</ul>

## Credits
<p>A HUGE thanks to @survivalq and their <a href="https://github.com/survivalq/SemiBoombox">SemiBoombox Mod</a> for critical funcionality for parts of this mod. If you're looking to make your own boombox mod or just play audio from a third-party, check their mod out, it is much better code!!!
