# Mimic

Mimic is a Skinwalker (Lethal Company Mod) inspired mod for R.E.P.O that allows the creatures of the game to sound like you or your friends!

### How it works:
This mod will record you and your friend's voices between an interval (30 - 120 seconds by default) and save the audio into a pool of clips. After a clip has been saved, a random clip from the pool will be played by each enemy on the current level.

### Planned Additions:

- Caching audio in memory (no more writing files)
- Optimizations!

### Changelog
- 1.0.1 : Fixed bugs and alleviated lag when sending audio to clients.
- 1.0.2 : File structure fixes.
- 1.0.3 : Added basic speech detection + configuration file (changing the settings drastically could have unknown effects).
- 1.0.4 : Config file fixes.
- 1.0.5 : Performance improvements + bug fixes.
- 1.1.0! : Overhaul of recording/playing clips + removal of third party dependencies + bug fixes.
- 1.1.1 : Fixed a bug where some users voices would never get recorded.
- 1.1.2 : Crash fixes!
