A simple mod that adds a few valuables and items in the form of potions. Be warned: this mod is not thoroughly tested in multiplayer.

If you want the potions to be rarer, consider installing other valuables mods. I'm not able to easily change the rarity myself.



# The Potions (Valuables)

### The Gravity Potion

This potion doesn't seem to be affected by gravity unless it's in the cart. It also creates a large, permanent field of anti gravity around where it breaks.



### The Gold Potion

A ***highly*** saught after potion. Splash this near any valuables and they'll sell for 20% more (configurable). Though, you have to ask yourself: is it worth killing the pig?



### The Health Potion

Heals all players by 20 (40 in singleplayer, configurable) and valuables by 10% in its splash radius.



### The Unstable Potion

This potion sells for quite a bit, however your grab beam seems to start a reaction that makes the potion shake violently. It explodes when destroyed, so be careful when extracting it.



### The Phoenix Potion

(Currently looks like a red health potion)
This potion can revive dead teammates when splashed near them.



### The Singularity Potion

(Currently looks like a black unstable potion)
When an object goes close enough to this potion, it'll stick next to it and get dragged along with it no matter how heavy it is. However, if it's broken, it will create a weak but *very* large explosion. 



### The Portal Potions (EXPERIMENTAL, disabled by default)

These potions spawn in pairs. When one breaks, they both break and create linked portals between them that can transfer objects and players (players must be in tumble to travel). These portals will vanish after 30 seconds (For players other than the host, the portals will remain visible forever but stop functioning after 30 seconds).


# The Elixirs (Items)




### The Stamina Elixir

A consumable elixir purchaseable from your local service station that grants full stamina. It has three charges that refill after every level. You can even share it with friends if you're all grabbing it when it's used!



### The Rocket Elixir

This joyous elixir is not for drinking, but rather for exploding your enemies. Taking the cap off launches it forward.


## Planned Content


**Portal Potions:** Add the ability to teleport the cart and all its contents without making a mess. fix bugs n' all that.

**Combat Potion:** *Extremely* fragile. When it breaks, it respawns all enemies and attracts them to its position.

**Time Potion:** Behaves opposite of the hourglass when held, speeding up time for the user. When broken, temporarily slows down time for nearby objects and potentially enemies (if I can figure out how).

**Rage Potion:**
All players in the splash radius will become invulnerable and start flailing violently for a short time, dealing high damage. Be careful around your valuables.

**Custom models and sounds:**
Each potion and elixir will have a unique look with their own custom models and sounds made by me! *(the pig will feel everything)*

**Your Suggestions!**
I'm happy to take in your ideas. The crazier the idea the better.
