## Clear UI

Makes the text clearer on all menus and HUD by removing the post-processing effects.

## Configuration
The following requires REPOConfig, which is included when installing with a mod manager.\
If you are installing manually, you will need to install REPOConfig separately, or edit the `soundedsquash.clearui.cfg` file directly.
1. Use the MODS button on the main menu or the in-game menu to change the settings.
2. Open the Clear UI page.
   - **Bloom**: The glow effect behind text.
   - **Chromatic Aberration**: The color separation effect. Most visible around the edges of the screen.
   - **Lens Distortion**: Curves the text. Most visible around the edges.
